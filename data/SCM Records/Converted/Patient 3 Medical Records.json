No mutation is detected. 07 July 2025 Comment 1. A negative or wild type result does not rule out the possibility of a mutation which is below the limits of detection by this assay or the possibility of other uncommon EGFR mutations outside the coverage of this assay. 2. The ability of the test to detect the relevant mutation may be dependent on tumour sampling. Clinical correlation is essential. Type of Test Qualitative detection of specific gene fusions for ALK, ROS1, RET as well as MET exon 14 skipping mutation and expression imbalance for ALK, ROS1 and RET. Results ALK Fusion: Not detected ROS1 Fusion: Not detected RET Fusion: Not detected MET Exon 14 skipping mutation: Not detected SUMMARY Overall, no ALK, ROS-1 and RET fusion is detected. No MET exon 14 skipping mutation is present. Comment 1.

Reference was made to prior MRI - BRAIN 09/07/2025; CT, Thorax 11/06/2025; FINDINGS Main Findings: The nodular density in the anterior aspect of the left lower lobe (biopsy proven malignancy) demonstrates interval decrease in size and metabolic resolution, now measuring 2.0 cm vs previously 2.3 cm (prev SUVmax 6.9). There are two new adjacent mildly FDG-avid ground glass opacities, one measuring 0.7 cm (SUVmax 2.9) (Se 4/134) and another more inferior measuring 0.9 cm (SUVmax3.6) (Se 4/156), these are likely inflammatory in aetiology. There is near complete resolution of the previously seen intensely FDG-avid nodule in the apical segment of the right lower lobe with residual adjacent faintly FDG-avid ground glass opacities, these are likely infective/inflammatory in nature. Interval near-complete metabolic resolution of previously seen FDG-avid left infrahilar nodes with remnant mild metabolic activity (SUVmax 2.8) (Se 1401/137). Fairly stable scattered tiny pulmonary nodules, too small for PET resolution, indeterminate. For example, right upper lobe (Se 4/93) and middle lobe (Se 4/99). Tiny new right supraclavicular node seen measuring up to 0.4 cm with mild FDG uptake is indeterminate and can be followed up (SUVmax 3.7) (series 1401, image 92). Otherwise, no definite suspicious hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy or distant metastasis. Other Findings: No suspicious FDG-avid intracranial lesion detected. 2025-09-26 16:16  Current Location: NCC-OP Pharmacy L1 Linear FDG uptake in the muscles of mastication are likely related to muscular tension. No FDG-avid cervical, mediastinal or axillary lymphadenopathy. Cardiomegaly. No pleural effusion detected. No suspicious FDG-avid lesion detected in the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenals and kidneys. Tiny hypodensity in the right hepatic lobe (Se 3/186) is too small to be accurately characterized. Uncomplicated cholelithiasis. Bilateral extra-renal pelvis. Mild left adrenal thickening with physiological FDG uptake. No FDG-avid abdominal or pelvic lymphadenopathy detected. There is no ascites. No suspicious FDG-avid bone lesion detected. CONCLUSION Since prior FDG PET/CT performed on 11 July 2025, The nodular density in the anterior aspect of the left lower lobe (biopsy proven malignancy) demonstrates interval decrease in size and metabolic resolution. There are new adjacent mildly FDG-avid ground glass opacities likely inflammatory in aetiology. There is near complete resolution of the previously seen intensely FDG-avid nodule in the apical segment of the right lower lobe with residual adjacent ground glass opacities and centrilobular nodularities, these are likely infective/inflammatory in nature. Interval near-complete metabolic resolution of previously seen FDG-avid left infrahilar nodes with remnant mild metabolic activity representing good treatment response. Fairly stable scattered tiny pulmonary nodules, too small for PET resolution, indeterminate. Tiny new right supraciavicular node with mild FDG uptake Is indeterminate and can be followed up.

        "History, Examination and Investigations": "Dr Daniel Tan's Clinic Reason for review: On neoadjuvant Osimertinib since 25 July 2025 Subjective: Patient seen CTS on 23 Sep 2025 The patient is agreeable to proceed with surgery tentatively scheduled on 8/10/25 as SDA, and Was asked to stop her osimertinib on 6/10/25 with mouth sore ltchy skin very dry body 2x/day stools, watery 1st episode Chest tightness/pain after chest trauma, when breathing, left chest with dygeusia Objective Dry skin Clear lungs Heart okay",
        "Investigations": "Common Lab Results (CBC,Full Blood Count,Chem,LFT): 23/09/25 Haemoglobin: 11.2(L), WBC: 4.18, Haematocrit: 34.2(L), Platelets: 108(L). 23/09/25 Neut: 71.0% , Neut Abs: 2.97, MCV: 91.2% , Lymph: 17.5% , Mono: 10.0% , Eos: 1.0% , Baso: 0.5% . 23/09/25 Na: 140, K+: 3.7, Cl: 101, HCO3: 30.8(H), Urea: 4.4, Cre: 65, Glu:4.1. 23/09/25 TP: 70, Alb: 39(L), Bil: 12, AST: 26, ALT: 16, ALP: 47. 23/09/25 PT: 11.3, APTT: 27.1. 18/09/25 CEA: 7.0(H). PET/CT F-18 FDG Body Scan with IV Contrast - Nuclear Med (2025-09-18 12:57:04) Comparison was made prior FDG PET/CT performed on 11 July 2025 (RadLink). Reference was made to prior MRI - BRAIN 09/07/2025; CT, Thorax 11/06/2025; FINDINGS Main Findings: The nodular density in the anterior aspect of the left lower lobe (biopsy proven malignancy) demonstrates interval decrease in size and metabolic resolution, now measuring 2.0 cm vs previously 2.3 cm (prev SUVmax 6.9). There are two new adjacent mildly FDG-avid ground glass opacities, one measuring 0.7 cm (SUVmax 2.9) (Se 4/134) and another more inferior measuring 0.9 cm (SUVmax3.6) (Se 4/156), these are likely inflammatory in aetiology. 2025-09-26 16:16  Current Location: NCC-OP Pharmacy L1 There is near complete resolution of the previously seen intensely FDG-avid nodule in the apical segment of the right lower lobe with residual adjacent faintly FDG-avid ground glass opacities, these are likely infective/inflammatory in nature. Interval near-complete metabolic resolution of previously seen FDG-avid left infrahilar nodes with remnant mild metabolic activity (SUVmax 2.8) (Se 1401/137). Fairly stable scattered tiny pulmonary nodules, too small for PET resolution, indeterminate. For example, right upper lobe (Se 4/93) and middle lobe (Se 4/99). Tiny new right supraclavicular node seen measuring up to 0.4 cm with mild FDG uptake is indeterminate and can be followed up (SUVmax 3.7) (series 1401, image 92). Otherwise, no definite suspicious hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy or distant metastasis. Other Findings: No suspicious FDG-avid intracranial lesion detected. Linear FDG uptake in the muscles of mastication are likely related to muscular tension. No FDG-avid cervical, mediastinal or axillary lymphadenopathy. Cardiomegaly. No pleural effusion detected. No suspicious FDG-avid lesion detected in the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenals and kidneys. Tiny hypodensity in the right hepatic lobe (Se 3/186) is too small to be accurately characterized. Uncomplicated cholelithiasis. Bilateral extra-renal pelvis. Mild left adrenal thickening with physiological FDG uptake. No FDG-avid abdominal or pelvic lymphadenopathy detected. There is no ascites. No suspicious FDG-avid bone lesion detected. CONCLUSION Since prior FDG PET/CT performed on 11 July 2025, The nodular density in the anterior aspect of the left lower lobe (biopsy proven malignancy) demonstrates interval decrease in size and metabolic resolution. There are new adjacent mildly FDG-avid ground glass opacities likely inflammatory in aetiology. There is near complete resolution of the previously seen intensely FDG-avid nodule in the apical segment of the right lower lobe with residual adjacent ground glass opacities and centrilobular nodularities, these are likely infective/inflammatory in nature. Interval near-complete metabolic resolution of previously seen FDG-avid left infrahilar nodes with remnant mild metabolic activity representing good treatment response. Fairly stable scattered tiny pulmonary nodules, too small for PET resolution, indeterminate. Tiny new right supraclavicular node with mild FDG uptake is indeterminate and can be followed up. Otherwise, no definite suspicious hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy or distant metastasis. 2025-09-26 16:16  Current Location: NCC-OP Pharmacy L1 =Comms= Explained progesterone receptor on PET CT. R supraclavicular LN appears reactive and not in line with disease response seen in other tumor in primary and hilar LN. Would recommend to proceed with curative surgery under CTS if they are agreeable. Husband queried if more time can be given on neoadjuvant treatment prior to surgery as she is responding well Explained that curative intent would still require surgery -- and hence would not advise to prolong decision. Family also felt that they wanted more input from other surgeons (either private or public) prior to making a decision on op as they feel that it is a big decision. After a long discussion, decision made to continue osimertinib, keep old surgery booking date for now. They will contact team if keen to change surgical provider or further plans",
