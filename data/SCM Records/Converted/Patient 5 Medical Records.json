Left upper lobe adenocarcinoma, with involvement of 1 central lymph node, and findings of pleural nodules that were too small to be picked up on the initial scan but are biopsy positive for malignancy as well. Biopsy of pri tumour was also found to be positive for a EGFR mutation, which has implications of choice of therapy. Implications of pleural nodules explained: suggest that there is some spread of cancer to lung 2025-09-29 13:12  Current Location: NCC ATU L10 lining, though too small to be visible on initial imaging. This is non-contiguous with the lung disease, hence we have to consider that this could be hematogenous spread. In this case, there is a possibility of residual disease in the pleura (and/or other parts of body) - if so, although primary tumour and LN have been adequately resected, this may progress over time. Stage of disease given pleural involvement would also technically be T2N2M 1a - ie. Stage IV. Explain role of systemic therapy post-surgery to eradicate/control micromets In her case, exact regimen and duration of therapy is not so clear cut. Whilst there are biopsy-positive pleural nodules, primary tumour has been resected and there are no other visible sites of disease at present. One option would be to treat with a standard \"adjuvant\" regime after adequate wound healing, with close follow up given the caveat of pleural involvement Regimen discussed: - Adjuvant chemotherapy with Pemetrexed/Platinum x 4 cycle (based on previous metaanalyses (LACE 2008, Cochrane 2015), absolute increase in survival by 4-5% at 5 years) - Followed by adjuvant Osimertinib until progression or unacceptable toxicity up to 3 years (as per ADAURA: Improved DFS compared to placebo with/without prior adjuvant chemotherapy - at 24m approx 90% disease-free across all resected stages vs 44% with placebo; 5Y overall survival 88% vs 78% across all subgroups,85% vs 67% in Stage IIIA (AJCC7)) as EGFR mutant. Alternatives: upfront Osimertinib (FLAURA) or Osimertinib/Chemo (FLAURAZ2) given that patient technically upfront metastatic at diagnosis - albeit duration of therapy to then be rediscussed depending on her progress. Would favour the latter if so, given that the combination of osi+chemo has been found to have better PFS/OS than osi alone, and as patient is baseline otherwise quite fit. Side effects (including but not limited to): - Pemetrexed: Fatigue, hyperpigmentation, desquamation, skin rash, alopecia; nausea, anorexia, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhoea. Anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia; Neuropathy; Liver toxicity - Cisplatin: can cause vomiting, nausea, bone marrow depression (anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), hair thinning 2w after first dose, mucositis, nephrotoxicity, peripheral neuropathy, otoxocity - Osimertinib: once daily 80mg oral tablet; Rashes, diarrhoea, electrolyte disturbances; rarely anorexia, nausea, vomiting, low blood counts, liver derangements, kidney derangements and pneumonitis Will need to do hepatitis screen prior as risk of viral reactivation with chemo, and would require folic acid to be taken daily and Vitamin B12 prior to treatment and every 3 cycles with Pemetrexed Explained need for neutropenic diet. Patient and family understand. After contemplation, opted for Pem/Cis+Osimertinib concurrently first - will aim to start next week if wound has healed adequately by then.
