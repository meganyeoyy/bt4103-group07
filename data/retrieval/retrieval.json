In this situation , neoadjuvant chemotherapy+HER2 targeted therapy allows for early systemic control as well as allows for downsizing/downstaging of disease . It allows us to test disease biology as well and depending on whether patient achieves pathCR or not , we may be able to escalate adjuvant treatment accordingly . It also allows for increased breast conservation . If HER2 FISH negative - will proceed with chemotherapy alone in neoadjuvant setting In this situation , given HR+ HER2- and post-menopausal status , there could be an utility of genomic tests if she has not more than 3 affect lymph nodes . Genomic testing may then offer a possibility to omit chemotherapy if given in adjuvant setting .
