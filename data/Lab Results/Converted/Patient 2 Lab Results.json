There is some subcutaneous\ninflammation but this appears to be related to the main dermal infiltrate rather\nthan a separate panniculitic process. Please correlate clinically.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION\n(A) The specimen is received in formalin, labelled with patient's data and\ndesignated \"skin biopsy over left foot for histology\". It consists of a punch\nbiopsy measuring 3.5mm in diameter and 2mm thick. No discrete lesion is seen\ngrossly. The skin surface appears unremarkable.\n(Al; no reserve)\n(B) Fresh tissue received for immunofluorescence. It consists of skin measuring\n0.3 x 0.4cm with underlying tissue measuring 0.3cm.\n(B1; no reserve)\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION\nSections show skin to depth of subcutis. There is a heavy interstitial dermal\nmixed infiltrate of lymphocytes, eosinophils and neutrophils. There is some\nfocal extension into subcutis, with focal multinucleated giant cells. No\ndefinite granulomas seen. There is some superficial dermal oedema, but otherwise\ndefinite basal clefting of epidermis or other blister formation is not seen.\nThere is some suggestion of obliteration of superficial capillaries with some\nred blood cell extravasation, together with some mild endothelial cell reactive\nchanges and scattered karyorrhectic debris. Epidermis itself is relatively\nunremarkable with basketweave orthokeratosis; no interface changes seen. PAS\nstaining is negative for fungi. Alcian blue staining is negative for significant\ndermal mucin. No malignancy seen.\nDirect immunofluorescence shows focal 1-2+ deposition of C3 around a few\nsuperficial capillaries; it is negative for significant deposition of IgG, IgA,\nIgM and fibrinogen.\nComment: Special stains, immunohistochemistry and/or in-situ hybridisation are\nperformed with in-house positive and/or negative controls which show\nsatisfactory performance. Immunofluorescence studies are performed using\ninternal controls and show satisfactory results. For tests performed on\nexternally processed material, it is unknown if their pre-analytical\ncharacteristics will contribute to variation in staining.\nPathologist\nDR LIM KOK HING\n25/06/2025"
