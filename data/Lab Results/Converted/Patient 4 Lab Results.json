Had MRCP in private - multiple hepatic\nlesion, ?primary ascending colon lesion, mets to nodes/mesentary and 1x lung mets.\nRequiring 2nd opinion report for DSO review.\nTECHNIQUE\nThis study was performed in on 01/08/2025 and images uploaded into PACS for second\nopinion reporting.\nTi-weighted and T2-weighted images with administration of intravenous contrast (Gadovist)\nwere available for review\nFINDINGS\nThe liver is enlarged and there are multiple hepatic masses compatible with those\ndue to metastatic deposits. The largest of these lie at the right lobe of the liver,\nmeasuring 11 cm (11.2 cm) (series 5, image 18). Central irregular necrosis is present\nwithin the larger masses. No biliary dilatation is demonstrated. Multiple gallstones\nare present within the gallbladder with no pericholecystic inflammation.\nA large lobulated soft tissue mass is present in the ascending colon (5.5 cm) (series\n5, image 43) with a length of 9 om (9.2 om) (series 4, image 20) with marked mural\nthickening of the wall. There is stranding and irregularity of the serosal surface\nwith likely invasion of the peritoneum at the right para colic gutter. This is associated\nwith a lobulated mass at the mesentery (2.2 cm) (series 5, image 43) in keeping with\nan enlarged mesenteric node.\nEnlargement of the aorto caval lymph node (0.8 cm) (series 5, image 34) and retrocaval\nlymph node is present (0.9 cm) (series 5, image 26).\nA large soft tissue mass is present at the right lower lobe indenting into the posterior\nmediastinum(7.2 cm) (series 9, image 7) compatible with a metastatic deposit.\nThe pancreas, spleen and the adrenals are unremarkable. The kidneys are normal. Both\nkidneys enhance in a normal manner. A few renal cysts are present with the largest\nat the left lower pole.\nCONCLUSION\nSoft tissue mass at the ascending colon is compatible with a large primary malignancy\nwith evidence of mesenteric and para-aortic lymph node involvement. Multiple hepatic\nmetastases are present and there is a large mass in the right lower lobe that is\npresumed to be metastatic in origin.\nReport Indicator: May need further action\nised by: Cheah Foong Koon, Senior Consultant, 06447E\nised Date/Time: 04/09/2025 10:57\n(For your attention)"
